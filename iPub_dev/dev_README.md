## Overview
[description](IPub is an internet publicity site mainly for: businesses-small medium large, organisations, individuals who want to be noticed across the globe via the internet in terms of the productsthey sell, services they offer, or what they do. This can be accomplished by posting or uploading photographs that give a clear description of their business, the products they sell or services they offer. More disk space could be acquired by these businesses inorder for them to be able to upload videos.)

[structure](social publicity platform, ease of use, better user experience)

[users](user:operator and user:visitor)
-user:operator is a user of the iPub platform that manages an iPub account, can post pubs, view analysis of user:visitor, starred, and is system affiliated. starring depends on developer defined constants
-user:visitor is a normal internet surfer that visits the iPub platform to view pubs and gets information on how to buy products or recieve services from user:visitor, can rate pubs, non-system affiliated

[system](requires no admin, manages itself)

[pubs](special characteristics)
-views: the number of ratings a pub has
-priority: the degree of being seen by user:visitor on first page land. priority of a pub would depend on the category of product or service it belongs to. based on ratio of pub views to the the average of pub views for that category

[profit](iPub could realise profit in some ways)
-user:operator needs to pay for extra disk space if there's need to post a pub with a video file. most well to do businesses will somehow go in for this because the charge per month is considerably fair and the added advantage visual pubs have on the audience
-user:operator with 3, 4, 5 stars are required to pay a small fee inorder to do more pubs. with 3, 4, 5 stars, a business must be doing well because it means its products have more views or ratings and certainly there is an income flow-in.
-user:operator can also pay to get its pubs placed on a priority zone in the platform for audience to always see

[tax](levied on user:operator)
-starring tax: for user:operator with stars 3 <= stars <= 5
-video pub tax: for user:operator requiring to post video pubs
-priority zone tax: for user:operator requiring its pub to be easily seen by user:visitor
